Recent Facebooks scare have gotten us to start re-thinking is there a way to own your own personal data and still be able to interact with the global community? What about owning assets or your own identity for that matter? Huge central ''Honeypots\", like Facebook where it has a single point to enter for hacking data, a decentralized blockchain infastructure could help eliminate that threat totally. We see truth machine printed heavily through out but our authors make a large distinction that blockchain itself doesn't verify the information input, we still need truthfulness businesses to act accordingly.\nThe future of algroithim designs I believe will help create a network for verification across mutiple blockchains. If you have any interest in the blockchain space I highly reccomend this book. #thetruthmachine #blockchain #bitcoin","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":17},"end":{"line":5,"column":232,"offset":928},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":17},"end":{"line":5,"column":232,"offset":928},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":929}}}}

# Quick Bites:

If one needs to understand what does the future of warfare will look like, I believe it is right here. James Rickards is by far one of my favorite authors in the finance realm. This book goes into great length about the mishaps that happened right before 2008. Talks about how China and Russia are ultimately playing for a world dominate currency not the USD. James like myself believe the IMF will be bailing out the Central Banks with SDRs, or what I like to call IMF tokens.
This was published in 2010, Rickards has been a strong advocate for gold monetary policy. Fantastic read for anyone interested in finance.

# Quick Bites
As information turns into currency, I think it's important to reevaluate where our information comes from and how do we digest all of this high-frequency of 'breaking news'. 'Information and Society' is about today's era of instant information gratification, we have ready access to opinions, rationalizations, and superficial descriptions. Much harder to come by is the foundational knowledge that informs a principled understanding of the world. I think we will see a new frontier in information science as everyone on the planet gets more connected with smartphones and universal access to the internet. ðŸ“š

# Quick Bites:

Many conversations have been around, what will blockchain bring us? Recent Facebook scare have gotten us to start re-thinking is there a way to own your own personal data and still be able to interact with the global community? What about owning assets or your own identity for that matter? Huge central ''Honeypots", like Facebook where it has a single point to enter for hacking data, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure could help eliminate that threat totally. We see truth machine printed heavily through out but our authors make a large distinction that blockchain itself doesn't verify the information input, we still need truthfulness businesses to act accordingly.
The future of algorithm designs I believe will help create a network for verification across multiple blockchains. If you have any interest in the blockchain space I highly recommend this book. #thetruthmachine #blockchain #bitcoin
